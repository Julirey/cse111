Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    This semester I was able to see the power of functions through their
    reusability and organization benefits, which was around the time
    when the assignments started to get more complex. Having the capacity 
    to divide almost every single part of my program into functions allowed 
    me to much better comprehend and manage my code in a way that was both 
    intuitive and that made me feel in control. 

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    The value of test functions comes from their ability to quickly and 
    accurately assess if a function works as intended. They simplify the 
    process of finding errors within said functions and save time by 
    automatically performing all the scenarios that the programmer 
    specified for it to check.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    When troubleshooting, I usually read the error message first to get
    a clue of what might be causing the problem. If that doesn't give me
    what I need to fix it or if there is no error message, I go through 
    the code and look for the section that handles the result that presents
    the problem. I analyze it to make sure that I comprehend it first,
    then if the fix doesn't seem apparent I would just experiment with it
    until I get it fixed.

    One thing I could do to improve my process of troubleshooting would be 
    to isolate the section that I believe contains the problem and check 
    each part one at a time.
